One of the most common issues that players face is the game not starting or launching after installing the crack by Reloaded. This can be caused by various factors, such as incompatible drivers, corrupted files, missing updates, or antivirus interference. Here are some steps that you can try to fix this issue:
 
- Make sure that your PC meets the minimum system requirements for Battlefield 3. You can check them [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1238820/).
- Update your graphics card drivers to the latest version. You can download them from the official website of your graphics card manufacturer.
- Run the game as an administrator. Right-click on the game's shortcut or executable file and select "Run as administrator".
- Disable your antivirus or firewall temporarily. Some antivirus programs may block or delete some files from the crack, causing the game to not start. You can add an exception for the game's folder in your antivirus settings or turn it off completely while playing.
- Verify the integrity of the game files. You can do this by using a tool like [SKiDROW CODEX](https://www.skidrowcodex.net/battlefield-3-reloaded/), which can scan and repair any corrupted or missing files from the game.
- Install all the updates and patches for the game. You can find them on various websites, such as [MegaGames](https://megagames.com/fixes/battlefield-3-v10-all?noradio=1), which offer fixes and improvements for the game.

If none of these steps work, you may have to reinstall the game and the crack from scratch. Make sure that you follow the instructions carefully and backup your save files before doing so.

- Lower your graphics settings. Battlefield 3 is a very demanding game that requires a lot of resources from your PC. If your PC is not powerful enough to handle the high settings, you may experience performance issues or crashes. Try lowering your resolution, texture quality, anti-aliasing, and other settings to see if it improves your situation.
- Clean your PC and monitor its temperature. Dust and dirt can accumulate inside your PC over time, affecting its cooling system and causing it to overheat. This can lead to crashes and damage to your hardware. You should clean your PC regularly with compressed air or a soft brush and make sure that it has enough ventilation. You can also use a program like [HWMonitor](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html) to check your CPU and GPU temperature and fan speed.
- Increase your virtual memory. Virtual memory is a part of your hard drive that acts as an extension of your RAM. If your RAM is not enough to run the game smoothly, you may experience crashes or slowdowns. You can increase your virtual memory by following these steps:
    1. Open Control Panel and click on System and Security.
    2. Click on System and then on Advanced system settings.
    3. Under Performance, click on Settings and then on Advanced.
    4. Under Virtual memory, click on Change.
    5. Uncheck Automatically manage paging file size for all drives.
    6. Select your drive where Windows is installed and click on Custom size.
    7. Enter a value that is 1.5 times your RAM size in both Initial size and Maximum size boxes.
